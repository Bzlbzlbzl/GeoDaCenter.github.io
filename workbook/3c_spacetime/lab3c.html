<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab, we will cover the basic mechanics for setting up <em>time-enabled</em> variables in GeoDa through the <strong>Time Editor</strong>. These variables then become available for a simple form of space-time exploration in the sense of comparative statics. By means of the <strong>Time Player</strong>, maps and graphs pertaining to a given variable can be shown for different time periods, allowing for an albeit limited assessment of space-time dynamics. To illustrate these features, we will use the data set with socio-economic characteristics for 55 New York City sub-boroughs.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>With GeoDa launched and all previous projects closed, we start by loading the NYC Data from the <strong>Sample Data</strong> tab in the <strong>Connect to Data Source</strong> dialog. Since we will be creating a project file to store the space-time definitions that we construct, it is best to save a copy of this data set to a working directory. To accomplish this, we use <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong> and select ESRI Shapefile as the format. In the examples that follow, we have used <strong>NYC_Sub_borough_Area</strong> as the file name.</p>
<p>Re-opening a project with the new data set yields the familiar themeless base map.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="time-editor" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Time Editor</h2>
<p>We start the process of <em>grouping</em> the data for the same variable over different time periods by invoking <strong>Time &gt; Editor</strong> from the main menu.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/1_475_time_editor_menu.png" alt="Time Editor in menu" width="15%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, we can select the <strong>Time</strong> icon on the toolbar (the latter brings up both the <strong>Time Editor</strong> and the <strong>Time Player</strong>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/1_476_time_icon.png" alt="Time toolbar icon" width="10%" />
<p class="caption">

</div>
<p>This brings up the <strong>Time Editor</strong> interface.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<div id="grouping-variables" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Grouping variables</h3>
<p>The logic behind the time editor is that different variables are <em>grouped</em> into a single label, with an attached index that refers to the time period. For example, if we wanted to explore the evolution of the percentage households with children over time (the <strong>kidsxxxx</strong> variables in the data set), we would <em>group</em> the six variables <strong>kids2000</strong> to <strong>kids2009</strong> as a new time-enabled variable <strong>kids</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Time Editor</strong> interface is organized into three panels. The panel on the left, labeled <strong>Ungrouped Variables</strong> contains the variables with their original variable name, and, after some operations, the variables that are not time-enabled (for example, a variable like the ID for the sub-borough, which does not change over time). The middle panel, <strong>New Group Details</strong>, is where the name and time labels for the new grouped variable can be edited. The right-most panel, <strong>Grouped Variables</strong> lists the result of the grouping operations.</p>
<p>The first step is to select the variables that are to be grouped in the left panel.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_478_kids_group.png" alt="Selection of variables to be grouped" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Selection of variables to be grouped
</p>
</div>
<p>Clicking on the arrow button <strong>&gt;</strong> moves the variables over to the central panel, with a suggested variable name (<strong>kids200</strong>) and time labels (<strong>time 0</strong> through <strong>time 5</strong>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<div id="editing-the-time-label" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Editing the time label</h4>
<p>Both the time label and the variable name can be edited, as shown below. Also, individual variables can be moved up or down in the sequence (the sequence determines the order of the comparatives static graphs and maps) by selecting the variable and using the buttons at the bottom of the panel. In addition, any variable can be moved out of the grouping, back to the ungrouped variables list, by selecting it and clicking on the left arrow button (<strong>&lt;</strong>) to the right of the central panel. For example, since the observations for 2005 to 2009 are every year, but the first observation is for 2000, we may want to remove <strong>kids2000</strong> from the list by selecting it and clicking on <strong>&lt;</strong>. This moves <strong>kids2000</strong> back to the ungrouped variables panel, but it leaves the first time label in place. We remove this by right clicking on the panel and selecting <strong>Remove Time</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_496_removetime.png" alt="Removing variables and time labels" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Removing variables and time labels
</p>
</div>
<p>Next, we change the variable <strong>name</strong> from the suggested <strong>kids200</strong> to <strong>kids</strong> and start editing the time labels to show the actual year.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_480_editingtimelabel.png" alt="Editing variable name and time labels" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>At the end of the editing process, the <strong>New Group Details</strong> panels looks as below.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_481_kidsedited.png" alt="Variables ready to be grouped" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Variables ready to be grouped
</p>
</div>
<p>The final step in the grouping process is to activate the group by selecting the <strong>&gt;</strong> arrow to the right of the central panel. This moves the new variable name to the <strong>Grouped Variables</strong> panel and clears the central panel.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_482_kids_grouped.png" alt="Grouped variable defined" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Grouped variable defined
</p>
</div>
<p>The original five variables in the data table are now replaced by a single entry, showing a new variable <strong>kids</strong>, with the first time period in parentheses (<strong>2005</strong>). The <strong>kids2000</strong> variable is still listed individually. Note that the grouped variables have not been dropped as individual entries, they are just not displayed as such in the table. The new label in parentheses indicates that they have been grouped.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/2_483_grouped_kids_intable.png" alt="Grouped variable in the table" width="30%" />
<p class="caption">
Grouped variable in the table
</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, note that GeoDa is agnostic to what variables are grouped, so this procedure can also be used to group variables that do not necessarily correspond to different time periods. For example, this may be useful when constructing a box plot graph that shows the box plots for multiple variables in one window.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="saving-the-group-definitions-to-a-project-file" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Saving the group definitions to a Project File</h3>
<p>As we have seen previously in the discussion of custom categories, any special definition such as a grouped variable will be lost if it is not saved in a project file.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Once contained in a project file, the grouped variables can be re-used in later analyses. There can be several different project files associated with the same data layer, each focused on a special aspect.</p>
<p>The project file contains the <strong>time_ids</strong> specified in the time editor, and the new variable definitions under the <strong><group></strong> entry. In our example, the variable <strong>kids</strong> is composed of <strong>kids2005</strong> through <strong>kids2009</strong>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/3_004_project.png" alt="Grouped variable in project file" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Grouped variable in project file
</p>
</div>
<p>Note that in the current setup in GeoDa, the grouping of variables can only use one set of time periods, due to the synchronization mechanism that underlies the time player. So, in order to look at different time periods, such as six periods for one variable and three for another, two separate project files would need to be created. More precisely, any active grouping has to pertain to the same time labels for any grouped variable.</p>
<p>To illustrate the use of grouped variables, we create a new project file with the variables <strong>hhsiz</strong>, <strong>rent</strong>, <strong>rentpc</strong> and <strong>yrhom</strong> grouped for the three years 2002, 2005, and 2008. We store this in a new project file, say <strong>nyc_project2.gda</strong>. Then, we close the current project and start a new one by dropping the project file in the <strong>Connect to Date Source</strong> interface.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="time-player" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Time Player</h2>
<p>We start the time player by clicking on its icon, as above, or from the menu as <strong>Time &gt; Time Player</strong>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This brings up the simple player interface together with the time editor dialog. We will ignore the latter in the current discusion.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/4_502_timeplayer.png" alt="Time player control" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Time player control
</p>
</div>
<p>The time player shows the <strong>Current time</strong> at the top, which is the time label that corresponds with the first period of the grouped variable (2002 in our example). For any graph or map in a current window, the time player will cycle through the time periods for the grouped variable(s) displayed. The radio button on the slider shows the progression over time. The controls at the bottom move the player forward automatically using the single arrow <strong>&gt;</strong>, or manually forward or backward using the double arrows <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>. The default is to <strong>Loop</strong> (box checked) and to move forward (<strong>Reverse</strong> <em>not</em> checked). Note that <em>forward</em> is whatever order was used in the time editor, and is not automatically or necessarily the correct time sequence. As mentioned above, GeoDa is agnostic as to what is defined as the time order or time labels. Finally, the <strong>Speed</strong> of the automatic progression can be adjusted by means of slider button.</p>
<p>In practice, manual progressions typically provides the most insight.</p>
<p>We will illustrate the use of the time player in some simple comparative static analysis of the a-spatial as well as the spatial distribution of a variable over time. We will consider the box plot, scatter plot and choropleth map as examples.</p>
<div id="box-plot-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Box plot over time</h3>
<p>We start with a box plot. Selecting the box plot icon or menu item brings up the variable settings dialog, in the usual fashion. However, there is a difference with the case where no grouped variables are present.</p>
<p>Below the list of variables is a <strong>Time</strong> box that shows the currently active time label (2002 in our example). All time-enabled (grouped) variables in the interface have the first time label in parentheses next to their name (the variables without the parentheses are not time-enabled). A different time period can be selected from the <strong>Time</strong> drop down list, as displayed below. Once a different label is chosen, all variables in the list will show the updated label in parentheses.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/5_504_boxplottimechoice.png" alt="Box plot variable selection" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">
Box plot variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>For now, we stay with the default time of 2002 and click on <strong>OK</strong> to bring up the box plot. In the default setting, the box plots for all time periods are shown side by side, using the same axis for the associated values. In our example, this clearly demonstrates the upward trend in median rent, something that would not be obvious in a standard (not time-enabled) box plot, since such plot is centered on its own median. In the default setting, the descriptive statistics for each period are listed below the plot.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/5_505_rent3box.png" alt="Multiple time period box plot" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Multiple time period box plot
</p>
</div>
<p>We can again use linking to identify the outliers, assess whether they remain outliers over time, and show them in a map. In this particular example, we have a few suspicious observations with a value of 0, likely due to a coding error. We ignore this aspect for now.</p>
<p>The time-enabled box plot has a number of interesting options. Perhaps the most useful of these is the <strong>Number of Box Plots</strong>. As shown, the default is to display <strong>All</strong>, but it is also possible to display any subset (1 or 2).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/5_005_singleboxoption.png" alt="Box plot options" width="30%" />
<p class="caption">
Box plot options
</p>
</div>
<p>For example, after changing this option to <strong>1</strong>, a single box plot appears, displaying the data for the first period, with 2002 in parentheses at the top of the graph. Consecutive clicking on the <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> icon in the <strong>Time Player</strong> will move the plot forward, one period at a time. The other options of the time player allow continuous looping, moving in reverse order, etc., as outlined above.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/5_507_singlebox.png" alt="Single time period box plot" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Single time period box plot
</p>
</div>
<p>Two other options of the time-enabled box plot warrant mentioning (the remaining options work the same way as for the standard box plot). The first item in the menu, <strong>Scale Options</strong> is set by default to <strong>Fixed scale over time</strong>. This only applies to the individual box plots, not to the (default) simultaneous graph. When cycling through the different time periods, the default is that the same scale is used for all. This allows for some visual impression of changing overall patterns over time (e.g., it would show the median bar moving up over time). When turned off, each individual time box plot is as it would be without having a time-enabled variable.</p>
<p>The option at the bottom of the menu pertains to <strong>Time Variable Options</strong> and is set by default to synchronize all variables through the time control. This means that if other graphs or maps have been constructed for time-enabled variables that all will move through the time periods as managed by the time player. This is typically the desired behavior. Only in exceptional circumstances should this be turned off, for example, where a given plot should not change by time period.</p>
</div>
<div id="scatter-plot-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Scatter plot over time</h3>
<p>The scatter plot for time-enabled variables uses the same logic as the box plot. Again, the variables selection interface is enhanced with two <strong>Time</strong> boxes at the bottom. This allows for different time periods for the x and y variables to be selected. The time-enabled variables are listed with the corresponding time label in parentheses.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/6_513_scatplotvarsrenthh.png" alt="Scatter plot variable selection" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Scatter plot variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>To illustrate the operation of the scatter plot, we select <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> as the variable for the x-axis and <strong>rentpc (2002)</strong> as the variable for the y-axis. The corresponding scatter plot takes on the usual form, but now has the time labels listed next to each variable at the top of the plot.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/6_511_scatplotrenthh1.png" alt="Household size and percent renters, 2002" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Household size and percent renters, 2002
</p>
</div>
<p>The corresponding scatter plot for the next period is brought up by clicking on <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> in the time player. In our example, we see how the slope of the linear fit is no longer significant in 2005. All the usual options apply (brushing, LOWESS smoother, etc.)</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/6_512_scatplotrenthh2.png" alt="Household size and percent renters, 2005" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Household size and percent renters, 2005
</p>
</div>
<p>One special feature of the time-enabled scatter plot is that it is very easy to consider a time-lagged bivariate regression. For example, we can select the <strong>yrhom</strong> variable in 2002 for the x-axis and the corresponding variable for 2005 in the y-axis.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/6_508_scatplotvars.png" alt="Scatter plot variable selection by period" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Scatter plot variable selection by period
</p>
</div>
<p>This results in an assessment of the magnitude of a one period temporal autoregression. In the graph below, it follows that the slope of 0.842 is highly significant.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/6_509_scatplot1.png" alt="Years in neighborhood, 2002-2005" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Years in neighborhood, 2002-2005
</p>
</div>
<p>In the same way as before, this can be moved forward over time. Since there are only three period labels, there will only be two scatter plots considering a one-period lag. All the usual options apply. We do not pursue this further here.</p>
</div>
<div id="maps-over-time" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Maps over time</h3>
<p>As our final example, we consider the application of time-enabled variables to choropleth mapping. This is one instance where the use of custom categories is especially useful. Unlike for the statistical graphs, there is no built-in <em>fixed scales</em> option for maps, but such scales can be defined through the <strong>Category Editor</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, say that we want to assess the spatial distribution of median household size by sub-borough over time. We could create any of the choropleth map options starting with the <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> variable and then cycle through the three time periods by means of the time player. However, each of these maps would have its own (relative) classification, making it less intuitive to assess changes in absolute magnitude over time (as opposed to relative magnitude).</p>
<p>Instead, we use the category editor to create a <strong>custom1</strong> break, starting with the <strong>hhsiz (2002)</strong> variable, making the breaks <strong>User-Defined</strong>, and turning the color scheme into <strong>sequential</strong>, with <strong>5</strong> categories. We manually enter the break points (somewhat arbitrarily) as 2, 2.5, 2.8 and 3. The result is as shown below.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/8_517_custombreaks.png" alt="Custom break settings, household size" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Custom break settings, household size
</p>
</div>
<p>We now choose <strong>Custom Breaks</strong> from the map menu and select <strong>custom1</strong> as the desired classification. The first map shows the spatial distribution of median household size for 2002.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="pics3c/8_518_map1.png" alt="Household size, custom breaks 2002" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Household size, custom breaks 2002
</p>
</div>
<p>Moving through to the next period (2005) with the time player yields a map with the same classifications. This way, in addition to comparing the spatial patterns, we see how the second category (2, 2.5) grows from 15 observations to 20, and the next to highest category (2.8, 3) goes from 13 to 7 observations.</p>

<p>Finally, moving to 2008 illustrates a further changing pattern, with now only 5 observations remaining in the categories above 2.8.</p>

<p>The use of custom categories to evaluate changes in the spatial pattern over time is particularly useful when the breaks are dictated by substantive concerns, such as specific policy-related criteria.</p>
