<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we will explore the EDA functionality in GeoDa, in particular the methods to deal with multiple variables, such as a scatter plot matrix, a parallel coordinate plot and conditional plots. We also illustrate the powerful linking and brushing capability that is central to the architecture of the program. We start with the description and visualization of a single variable, move on to the bivariate scatter plot, and close with a review of multivariate EDA.</p>
<p>We will use a data set with demographic and socio-economic information for 55 New York City sub-boroughs. The data are from the <a href="http://coredata.nyc">Furman Institute at NYU</a>. This data set is part of the GeoDa <strong>Sample Data</strong> and can be loaded directly into the program.</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>We open GeoDa and select (double click on the thumbnail map icon) the data set <strong>NYC Data</strong> from the list contained under the <strong>Sample Data</strong> tab, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:sampledata">1</a>.</p>

<p>The first two icons on the left pertain to univariate analyses, respectively the <strong>Histogram</strong> and <strong>Box Plot</strong>. The <strong>Scatter Plot</strong> extends this to bivariate association, and its generalization, the <strong>Scatter Plot Matrix</strong> consists of a collection of pairwise bivariate associations among multiple variables. A three variable set up is considered in the <strong>Bubble Chart</strong> and <strong>3D Scatter Plot</strong>, and full multivariate associations are explored in the <strong>Parallel Coordinate Plot</strong> and the <strong>Conditional Plot</strong>. We now consider each in turn, starting with the univariate approaches.</p>

<section id="analyzing-the-distribution-of-a-single-variable" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Analyzing the Distribution of a Single Variable</h2>
<section id="histogram" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Histogram</h3>
<p>We begin our analysis with the simple description of the distribution of a single variable. Arguably the most familiar statistical graphic is the histogram, which is a discrete representation of the density function of a variable. In essence, the range of the variable (the difference between maximum and minimum) is divided into a number of equal intervals (or bins), and the number of observations that fall within each bin is depicted in a bar graph.</p>
<p>The histogram functionality is started by selecting <strong>Explore &gt; Histogram</strong> from the menu, or by clicking on the <strong>Histogram</strong> toolbar icon, the left-most icon in the set in Figure <a href="#fig:histicon">5</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histicon"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_histogram_icon.png" alt="Histogram toolbar icon" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5: Histogram toolbar icon
</p>
</div>
<p>This brings up the <strong>Variable Settings</strong> dialog, which lists all the numeric variables in the data set (string variables cannot be analyzed). Scroll down the list as in Figure <a href="#fig:histvarlist">6</a> until you can select <strong>kids2009</strong>, the percentage of households with kids under age 18 in 2009.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 6: Histogram variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>After clicking <strong>OK</strong>, the default histogram appears, showing the distribution of the 55 observations over seven bins, as in Figure <a href="#fig:defaulthist">7</a>. The distribution tends to be skewed to the left, with a tail on the low end and most taller bins on the high end, suggesting more areas with a higher percentage of kids under 18.</p>

<img src="pics2/1_default_histogram.png" alt="Default histogram" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7: Default histogram
</p>
</div>
<p>There are two important options for the histogram. One is to set the number of bins for the default equal interval setting, the other is to customize the values of the cut-off points completely. We will postpone a consideration of the latter until the discussion of choropleth maps (in essence, a map version of a histogram).</p>
<p>The histogram options shown in Figure <a href="#fig:histoptions">8</a> are brought up in the usual fashion, by right clicking on the graph.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histoptions"></span>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<section id="selecting-the-number-of-histogram-bins" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Selecting the number of histogram bins</h4>
<p>After selecting the <strong>Choose Intervals</strong> option, a dialog appears that lets you set the number of bins explicitly. The default is 7, but in our example, we change this to 5, as in Figure <a href="#fig:hist5option">9</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:hist5option"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_interval5.png" alt="Histogram intervals set to 5" width="30%" />
<p class="caption">

<p>The resulting histogram now has five bars, as in Figure <a href="#fig:hist5bars">10</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Note how the wider bins for the histogram somewhat smooth the shape of the distribution.</p>
</section>
<section id="display-histogram-statistics" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Display histogram statistics</h4>
<p>A second important option for the histogram (and any other statistical graph) is to display descriptive statistics in the graph. This is accomplished by selecting <strong>View &gt; Display Statistics</strong> in the option menu shown in Figure <a href="#fig:histstats">11</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histstats"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_display_stats.png" alt="Display statistics option" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 11: Display statistics option
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Display Statistics</strong> option adds a number of descriptors below the graph. The summary statistics are given at the bottom, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:histsummary">12</a>. We see that the 55 observations have a minimum value of 0, a maximum of 48.1, median of 33.5, mean of 32.1 and a standard deviation of 10.4. We take the minimum value as is, even though a percentage of zero may seem suspicious. In addition, for the histogram, descriptive statistics are provided for each interval, showing the range for the interval, the number of observations as a count and as a percentage of the total number of observations, and the number of standard deviations away from the mean for the center of the bin. This allows us to identify potential outliers, e.g., as defined by those observations more than two standard deviations from the mean. In our example, the lowest category would satisfy this criterion.</p>
<p>The summary characteristics for a given bin also appear in the status bar when the cursor is moved over the corresponding bar. This works whether the descriptive statistics option is on or not. In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:histsummary">12</a>, the cursor is over the central bar.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histsummary"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_histwstats.png" alt="Histogram with descriptive statistics" width="70%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 12: Histogram with descriptive statistics
</p>
</div>
<p>Other options available in the Histogram are adjustments to various color settings (<strong>Color</strong>), saving the selection (see below), <strong>Copy the Image to Clipboard</strong> and saving the graph as an image file (see below).</p>
</section>
<section id="linking-a-histogram-and-a-map" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Linking a histogram and a map</h4>
<p>To illustrate the concept of <em>linked</em> graphs and maps, we first set the number of intervals for the histogram back to 7 (<strong>Choose Intervals &gt; 7</strong>). Then we select the three left-most bars in the histogram (click and shift-click to expand the selection). The highlighted bars keep their color, whereas the non-selected ones become transparent, as in the right-hand graph in Figure <a href="#fig:histmaplink">13</a>. This is the standard approach to visualize a selection in a graph in GeoDa.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Immediately upon selection of the bars in the graph, the corresponding observations in the map are also highlighted, as in the left-hand graph in Figure <a href="#fig:histmaplink">13</a>. In our current example, the map is a simple themeless map (all areal units are green), but in more realistic applications, the map can be any type of choropleth map, for the same variable or for a different variable. The latter can be very useful in the exploration of categorical overlap between variables.</p>
<p>In our example, the histogram bars at the low end of the distributions (i.e., with a low percentage of households with kids) correspond to sub-boroughs primarily located in Manhattan, which should not come as a surprise.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histmaplink"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_150_linkhistmap.png" alt="Linking a histogram and a map" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 13: Linking a histogram and a map
</p>
</div>
<p>The reverse linking works as well. For example, using a rectangular selection tool on the themeless map, we can select sub-boroughs in Manhattan and adjoining Brooklyn, as in the map in Figure <a href="#fig:maphistlink">14</a>. The linked histogram (right-hand graph in Figure <a href="#fig:maphistlink">14</a>) will show the attribute distribution for the selected spatial units as highlighted fractions of the bars (the transparent bars correspond to the unselected areal units).</p>
<p>In practice, we will be interested in assessing the extent to which the distribution of the selected observations (e.g., a sub-region) matches the overall distribution. When it does not, this may reveal the presence of <em>spatial heterogeneity</em>, to which we return in the discussion of scatter plot brushing.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:maphistlink"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_151_linkmaphist.png" alt="Linking a map and a histogram" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 14: Linking a map and a histogram
</p>
</div>
<p>As we have seen before, it is also possible to save the selection in the form of a 0-1 indicator variable with the <strong>Save Selection</strong> option.</p>
<p>The technique of linking, and its dynamic counterpart of <em>brushing</em> (more later) is central to the data exploration philosophy that is behind GeoDa <span class="citation" data-cites="Anselinetal:06a">(for a more elaborate exposition of the philosophy behind GeoDa, see Anselin, Syabri, and Kho <a href="#ref-Anselinetal:06a">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="saving-a-graph-as-an-image" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Saving a graph as an image</h4>
<p>A useful option associated with any graph in GeoDa is the possibility to save the graph as an image, in either <strong>png</strong> (the default) or <strong>bmp</strong> format. This process is started by selecting <strong>Save Image As</strong> from the options menu (right click on the graph and select the item as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:histsaveimg">15</a>).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:histsaveimg"></span>
<img src="pics2/1_saveimageas.png" alt="Save image as option" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 15: Save image as option
</p>
</div>
<p>The resulting dialog provides a way to specify a file name and a location where to save the file. The default file name in our example is <strong>NYC DataHistogramFrame.png</strong>. For the histogram without descriptive statistics, with 7 categories and selections highlighted, the corresponding image is as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:histimg">16</a>. This makes it easy to incorporate the graphs in a document.</p>

</section>
<section id="box-plot" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Box plot</h3>
<p>A box plot is an alternative visualization of the distribution of a single variable. It is invoked as <strong>Explore &gt; Box Plot</strong>, or by selecting the <strong>Box Plot</strong> icon in the toolbar, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:boxicon">17</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:boxicon"></span>
<img src="pics2/2_154_boxploticon.png" alt="Box plot toolbar icon" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 17: Box plot toolbar icon
</p>
</div>
<p>Identical to the approch followed for the histogram, next appears a <strong>Variable Settings</strong> dialog to select the variable. In GeoDa, the default is that the variable from any previous analysis is already selected. In our example, we continue with <strong>kids2009</strong> (see Figure <a href="#fig:histvarlist">6</a>). This brings up the box plot graph shown in Figure <a href="#fig:boxplot">18</a> (make sure to turn <em>off</em> any previous selection of observations).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:boxplot"></span>
<img src="pics2/2_155_boxplot.png" alt="Default box plot" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 18: Default box plot
</p>
</div>
<p>The box plot focuses on the quantiles of the distribution. The data points are sorted from small to large. The median (50 percent point) is represented by the horizontal orange bar in the middle of the distribution. The brown rectangle goes from the first quartile (25th percentile) to the third quartile (75th percentile). The difference between the values that correspond to the third (39.6773) and the first quartile (26.6943) is referred to as the <em>inter-quartile range</em> (IQR). The inter-quartile range is a measure of the spread of the distribution, a non-parametric counterpart to the standard deviation. In our example, the IQR is roughly 13 (39.6773 - 26.6943 = 12.9831).</p>
<p>The horizontal lines drawn at the top and bottom of the graph are the so-called <em>fences</em> or <em>hinges</em>. They correspond to the values of the first quartile less 1.5 IQR (i.e., roughly 26.7 - 1.5x13 = 7.2), and the third quartile plus 1.5 IQR (i.e., roughly 39.7 + 1.5x13 = 59.2). Observations that fall outside the fences are considered to be <em>outliers</em>.</p>
<p>In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:boxplot">18</a>, we have a single lower outlier, but no upper outliers. Note that the one lower outlier is the observation that corresponds with a value of 0 (the minimum), which we earlier had flagged as potentially suspicious. The outlier detection would seem to confirm this. Checking for <em>strange</em> values that may possibly be coding errors or suggest other measurement problems is one of the very useful applications of a box plot.</p>
<p>The default in GeoDa is to list the summary statistics at the bottom of the box plot. As was the case for the histogram, the statistics include the minumum, maximum, mean, median and standard deviation. In addition, the values for the first and third quartile and the resulting IQR are given as well. The listing of descriptive statistics can be turned off by unchecking <strong>View &gt; Display Statistics</strong> (i.e., the default is the reverse of what held for the histogram, where the statistics had to be invoked explicitly).</p>
<p>The typical multiplier for the IQR to determine outliers is 1.5 (roughly equivalent to the practice of using two standard deviations in a parametric setting). However, a value of 3.0 is fairly common as well, which considers only truly outlying observations as outliers. The multiplier to determine the fence can be changed with the <strong>Hinge &gt; 3.0</strong> option (right click in the plot to select the options menu, and then choose the hinge value, as in Figure <a href="#fig:boxhinge3option">19</a>).</p>

<p>Several other options for the box plot are the same as for the histogram, such as saving the selection, copying the image to the clipboard, and saving the graph as an image file.</p>
<p>Also, as is the case for any graph in GeoDa, linking is implemented. For example, selecting the lower outlier in the box plot will highlight the corresponding obbservation in the themeless map of sub-boroughs, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:linkboxmap">21</a>. The reverse process, consisting of first selecting in the map, works as well.</p>

<h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>The standard tool to assess a <em>linear</em> relationship between two variables is the scatter plot, a diagram with two axes, each corresponding to one of the variables. The observation (x, y) pairs are plotted as points in the diagram.</p>
<p>We create a scatter plot by clicking on its toolbar icon, or by selecting <strong>Explore &gt; Scatter Plot</strong> from the menu. The <strong>Scatter Plot</strong> icon is the third in the EDA group on the toolbar, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:scattericon">22</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scattericon"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 22: Scatter Plot toolbar icon
</p>
</div>
<p>This brings up the <strong>Scatter Plot Variables</strong> dialog where the variables for the X and Y axes need to be selected. In our example, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:scatvars">23</a>, we will choose the percentage of households with kids under age 18 in 2000 (<strong>kids2000</strong>) as the X-variable, and the percentage of households receiving public assistance (<strong>pubast00</strong>) as the Y-variable.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 23: Scatter Plot variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>Clicking <strong>OK</strong> brings up the scatter plot.</p>
<p>The default view of the scatter plot is to use the variables in their original scales (i.e., not standardized), show the axes through zero (as dashed lines), and fit a linear smoother (i.e., a least squares regression fit). In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:scatdefault">24</a>, there is only a horizontal axis, since all the x values are larger than zero.</p>
<p>In addition, at the bottom of the graph, several summary statistics are listed for the regression line. This includes the R<sup>2</sup> of the fit, and the estimate, standard error, t-statistic and p-value for both the intercept and the slope coefficient. This default view is illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:scatdefault">24</a>.</p>

<p>In the current setup, no observations are selected, so that the second line in the statistical summary in Figure <a href="#fig:scatdefault">24</a> (all red zeros) has no values. This line pertains to the selected observations. The blue line at the bottom relates to the unselected observation. The sum of the number of observations in each of the two subsets always equals the total number of observations, listed on the top line. The three lines are listed because of the default <strong>View</strong> setting of <strong>Regimes Regression</strong>, even though there is currently no active selection (see also below).</p>
<section id="scatter-plot-options" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Scatter Plot options</h4>
<p>The scatter plot has several interesting options, listed in Figure <a href="#fig:scatoptions">25</a>. As usual, these are brought up by right clicking in the view or by selecting <strong>Options</strong> in the menu.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scatoptions"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 25: Scatter Plot options
</p>
</div>
<p>Several of the options should by now be familiar, such as the <strong>Selection Shape</strong>, <strong>Color</strong>, <strong>Save Selection</strong> and the two ways to save the image. The <strong>Data</strong> item provides a choice between the variables on their original scale (the default) and the use of standardized variables. Note that when you use the standardized form, the slope of the linear smoother is also the correlation coefficient between the two variables.</p>
<p>The <strong>View</strong> option shows the default settings with the <strong>Statistics</strong> displayed below the graph, the <strong>Axes Through Origin</strong> shown as dashed lines, and the <strong>Status Bar</strong> active. Two other default settings are to have a <strong>Fixed Aspect Ratio</strong> and <strong>Regimes Regression</strong> active. When some observations are selected, the regimes regression setting will result in the computation of three different linear smoothers. We revisit this when we consider brushing the scatter plot.</p>
<p>The first of the view options is not set by default. It controls the precision by which the values are displayed on the axes. In our scatter plot in Figure <a href="#fig:scatdefault">24</a>, this is currently two digits. When checking <strong>Set Display Precision on Axes</strong>, a dialog pops up. For example, we can turn the precision to 1 digit, as in Figure <a href="#fig:displayprecision1">26</a>.</p>

<h4>LOWESS smoother</h4>
<p>We turn the precision back to 2 digits and explore a non-linear smoother of the scatter plot. A LOWESS nonlinear local regression fit reveals potential nonlinearities in the bivariate relationship and may suggest the presence of structural breaks <span class="citation" data-cites="Cleveland:79 Loader:99 Loader:04">(for a good overview of the methodological issues, see, e.g., Cleveland <a href="#ref-Cleveland:79">1979</a>; and Loader <a href="#ref-Loader:99">1999</a>, <a href="#ref-Loader:04">2004</a>)</span>. LOWESS stands for locally weighted scatter plot smoother and is slightly different from LOESS, a local polynomial regression (the two are often confused, but implement different fitting algorithms). In GeoDa, LOWESS is implemented and selected in the <strong>Smoother</strong> option, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:smoothoption">28</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Selecting the <strong>Show LOWESS Smoother</strong> option adds the nonlinear fit to the scatter plot. Note that by default the <strong>Show Linear Smoother</strong> option remains checked, so that this needs to be unchecked to see only the nonlinear fit. The respective graphs that result from each option are illustrated in Figures <a href="#fig:smoothwlinear">29</a> and <a href="#fig:smoothwolinear">30</a>. In practice, having both options selected facilitates an easy comparison of the two curve fits.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 30: LOWESS smoother without linear fit
</p>
</div>
<p>In our example, there is considerable evidence of a nonlinear relationship between the two variables. An alternative interpretation is to see this as an indication of a structural break, where in one subset of the data the slope is very steep, whereas in another it is fairly flat.</p>
<p>The nonlinear fit is driven by a number of parameters, the most important of which is the bandwidth. The parameters can be changed in the options by selecting <strong>Edit LOWESS Parameters</strong> in the <strong>Smoother</strong> option. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:bandwidth">31</a>, a small dialog is brought up in which the <strong>Bandwidth</strong> (default setting 0.20), <strong>Iterations</strong> and <strong>Delta Factor</strong> can be adjusted. The bandwidth determines the smoothness of the curve and is given as a fraction of the total range in X values. In other words, the default bandwidth of 0.20 implies that for each local fit (centered on a value for X), about one fifth of the scatter points are taken into account. The other options are technical and are best left to their default values.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>To obtain Figure <a href="#fig:smooth40">32</a>, we changed the bandwidth to 0.40, which results in a much smoother curve that brings out a possible structural break in the data in a more striking fashion.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:bandwidth"></span>
<img src="pics2/4_lowess040.png" alt="LOWESS bandwidth settings" width="30%" />

<p class="caption">
Figure 32: LOWESS smoother bandwidth 0.40
</p>
</div>
<p>The plot seems to suggest that the linear fit is really a compromise between two slopes. There is a steep slope for observations with a value for households with children above 40 percent, suggesting a major increase in public assistance with every increase in the percentage children. With values for <strong>kids2000</strong> below 40, the slope is much gentler and even flat in small subsets of the data.</p>
<p>The opposite effect is obtained when the bandwidth is made smaller. For example, with a value of 0.10, the resulting curve in Figure <a href="#fig:smooth10">33</a> is much more jagged and less informative.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:smooth10"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 33: LOWESS smoother bandwidth 0.10
</p>
</div>
<p>The literature contains many discussions of the notion of an optimal bandwidth, but in practice a trial and error approach is often more effective. In any case, a value for the bandwidth that follows one of these rules of thumb can be entered in the dialog. Currently, GeoDa does not compute these for you.</p>
<p>Finally, while one might expect the LOWESS fit and a linear fit to coincide with a bandwidth of 1.0, this is not the case. The LOWESS fit will be near-linear, but slightly different from a standard least squares result due to the locally weighted nature of the algorithm.</p>

<h3>Brushing the Scatter Plot – Spatial Heterogeneity</h3>
<p><em>Linking</em> and <em>brushing</em> are powerful techniques to assess structural breaks in the data, such as evidence of spatial heterogeneity. We have already seen how a selection in any of the views results in the same observation to immediately be selected in all other views through linking. Brushing is a dynamic extension of this process. This is the most insightful when applied to the combination of a map and a scatter plot, but it equally applies to all the other views <span class="citation" data-cites="Stuetzle:87 BeckerCleveland:87 Beckeretal:87 Monmonier:89 Anselinetal:06a">(for some early exposition and discussion of these ideas pertaining to so-called dynamic graphics, see, e.g., the classic references of Stuetzle <a href="#ref-Stuetzle:87">1987</a>; Becker and Cleveland <a href="#ref-BeckerCleveland:87">1987</a>; Becker, Cleveland, and Wilks <a href="#ref-Beckeretal:87">1987</a>; Monmonier <a href="#ref-Monmonier:89">1989</a>; as well as in the outline of legacy GeoDa functionality in Anselin, Syabri, and Kho <a href="#ref-Anselinetal:06a">2006</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The brushing process is initiated by setting up a selection shape in one of the views. The default is a rectangular shape, but we have seen earlier how that can be changed to a circle or a line. In our example, we keep the default. Click anywhere in the scatter plot and draw the pointer into a rectangular shape, as shown below. Note how the pointer is attached to a corner of the rectangle. At this point, the shape can be moved around in the view, dynamically changing the selection.</p>
<p>In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:brushscat1">34</a>, we have selected 22 observations. The purple line represents the original linear fit, the red line is the fit for the 22 selected observations, and the blue line is the fit for the other 33 observations. Below the three lines with the slope coefficients and fit statistics, the results are listed of a Chow test on structural stability are listed <span class="citation" data-cites="Chow:60">(Chow <a href="#ref-Chow:60">1960</a>)</span>. Clearly, in contrast to the overall purple and the blue line, there is no relationship at all for the selected observations in question, as evidenced by the horizontal red line. The Chow test confirms this by strongly rejecting (p &lt; 0.0005) the null hypothesis of equal coefficients (between the slopes of the blue and the red lines).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:brushscat1"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 34: Brushing the scatter plot – 1
</p>
</div>
<p>Because of the linking, the 22 selected observations are also highlighted in all the other views, such as the green themeless map shown in Figure <a href="#fig:brushmap1">35</a>. In an actual application, this map can be for a third variable, allowing us to investigate potential interaction effects.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 35: Linked map selection – 1
</p>
</div>
<p>With the <strong>Regimes Regression</strong> option turned on, the three linear fits change instantaneously as different observations are selected. Of course, the fits themselves are only meaningful when sufficient observations are part of the selection. For example, we can move the selection rectangle up and to the right, as in Figure <a href="#fig:brushscat2">36</a>, which yields a new selection of 10 observations, with associated regression lines. This time, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis (Chow test with p = 0.975).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:brushscat2"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 36: Brushing the scatter plot – 2
</p>
</div>
<p>Again, the matching locations are shown in the map in Figure <a href="#fig:brushmap2">37</a>. As the selection rectangle moves in the scatter plot, the highlighted sub-boroughs in the map change as well.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:brushmap2"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 37: Linked map selection – 2
</p>
</div>
<p>The process can also be reversed and started in a view other than the scatter plot. For example, we can brush the map (in our example in Figure <a href="#fig:brushmap3">38</a>, 10 observations are selected), and assess how the linear fits are affected in the scatter plot.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:brushmap3"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 39: Linked scatter plot selection – 1
</p>
</div>
<p>In Figure <a href="#fig:mapscat3">39</a>, the map selection results in a rejection of the null hypothesis of constant slopes with p &lt; 0.0031. In other words, the slope in the region we selected in the map is significantly different from the slope in the rest of the map, suggesting spatial heterogeneity.</p>
<p>As we brush across the map, we can assess the degree to which the linear relationship is stable. Any systematically changing slopes between clearly defined sub-regions of the observations would suggest the presence of spatial heterogeneity. For example, moving the selection rectangle north, as in Figure <a href="#fig:brushmap4">40</a>, makes the evidence for stuctural change somewhat weaker (as evidenced by the Chow test with p &lt; 0.01 shown in Figure <a href="#fig:mapscat4">41</a>).</p>

<p>As we identify subregions in the data with a different slope (structure) from the rest, we can assess this more formally through regression analysis (e.g., analysis of variance). This is facilitated by <strong>Saving</strong> the selection in the form of an indicator variable (with 1 for the selected observations). This new variable can then be incorporated in a regression specification.</p>

<section id="scatter-plot-matrix" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Scatter Plot Matrix</h3>
<p>A scatter plot matrix visualizes the bivariate relationships among several variables. The individual scatter plots are stacked such that each variable is in turn a dependent variable and an explanatory variable. In a sense, it is the visual counterpart of a correlation matrix. In GeoDa, the diagonal elements also contain a histogram for the variable in the corresponding row/column.</p>
<p>You start the scatter plot matrix by selecting the corresponding icon on the toolbar (part of the EDA icons), as in Figure <a href="#fig:scatmaticon">42</a>, or by choosing <strong>Explore &gt; Scatter Plot Matrix</strong> from the menu.</p>

<p>This brings up a dialog through which variables can be added or removed, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:scatmatvars">43</a>. The design of the interface is such that one selects a variable from the list on the left and clicks on the right arrow <strong>&gt;</strong> to include it in the list on the right (alternatively, one can double click on the variable name to move it to the right-hand column). The left arrow <strong>&lt;</strong> is there to remove a variable from the <strong>Include</strong> list.</p>

<p>As soon as two variables are selected, the scatter plot matrix is rendered in the background.

<p>The graph shows both positive and negative associations, as well as non-significant ones. Above each scatter plot, the slope of the linear fit is listed, with significance indicated by one * (p &lt; 0.05) or two ** (p &lt; 0.01). The histograms in the diagonal provide a sense of the shape of the distribution for each variable. Among others, the graph reveals a strongly significant and positive relationship between the percentage households with kids and public assistance (as we saw before in the scatter plot), and a strong negative and significant relationship between number of years in the residence and public assistance. The relationship between years in residence and percent households with kids is not significant.</p>
<p>As is customary, a right click (or control click) brings up the options. The defaults are the linear fit (<strong>Smoother &gt; Show Linear Smoother</strong>), with linking and brushing disabled (<strong>View &gt; Regimes Regression</strong> unchecked), and the slope values displayed. Selecting <strong>Add/Remove Variables</strong> bring back the variable selection dialog. In addition to the linear fit, the scatter plot matrix also supports a LOWESS fit, with the same parameter editing capability as in the standard scatter plot. This is invoked by selecting <strong>Smoother &gt; Show LOWESS Smoother</strong>, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:scatmatlowes1">46</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, with the brushing and linking functionality enabled (<strong>View &gt; Regimes Regression</strong> checked), potential structural breaks can be further investigated dynamically. As in the standard scatter plot, the red linear fit corresponds to the selected observations, the blue line is for the unselected ones and the purple line is for the complete sample.

<h2>Three Variables: Bubble Chart and 3D Scatter Plot</h2>
<p>Once we move beyond two variables, it becomes difficult to explicitly visualize the relationships among the variables in higher-dimensional space. Techniques to deal with such higher dimensions all boil down to reducing the dimensionality of the problem, i.e., attempting to show the relationships in a two-dimensional plane. In this section, we consider two of these techniques that work for situations in three dimensions (or, at most, four).</p>
<section id="bubble-chart" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Bubble chart</h3>
<p>The bubble chart is an extension of the scatter plot to include a third and possibly a fourth variable into the two-dimensional chart. While the points in the two-dimensional scatter plot remain as showing the association between two variables, the size of the points (the <em>bubble</em>) is used to introduce a third variable. In addition, the color shading of the points can be used to consider a fourth variable as well, although this may stretch our perceptual abilities.</p>
<p>The bubble chart is invoked from the menu as <strong>Explore &gt; Bubble Chart</strong> and from the toolbar by selecting the fifth icon, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:bubbleicon">49</a>.</p>

<p>The resulting graph, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:bubblechart">51</a> (after resizing the window somewhat), shows the same scatter plot as before, but now with the size and color of the circle reflecting the magnitude of the rent (red is high, blue is low). We see that the higher rents (larger bubbles) are situated in the lower left corner of the scatter plot. This suggests an interaction between the three variables, e.g., the higher median rent tends to be in sub-boroughs with a small percentage of households with children or receiving public assistance. This interaction between the three variables is not something we might have expected a priori (or, maybe it is, but the graph brings it out more explicitly). The null case would be that there is no structural relationship between the two original variables and the third, resulting in a graph with the size/color of the bubbles randomly distributed throughout.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual options we have seen before, the bubble chart has a few unique features. The first item, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:bubbleoptions">52</a>, allows one to choose from among several <strong>Classification Themes</strong> (as well as to create/select a custom classification). The default is the <strong>Standard Deviation</strong> theme, where the colors correspond to standard deviational units away from the mean (red colors above the mean, blue colors below the mean). We will revisit the different classification schemes when we discuss the <strong>Map</strong> functionality in GeoDa.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Another option specific to the bubble chart is to set the size of the bubble, with <strong>Adjust Bubble Size</strong> (the bottom item in the menu in Figure <a href="#fig:bubbleoptions">52</a>). This brings up a dialog with a slider to change the size of the circles, as in Figure <a href="#fig:bubblesize">53</a>. This is particularly useful when the default size overwhelms the graph. Note that the slider dialog must be closed before moving on.</p>

<h3>3D Scatter Plot</h3>
<p>An explicit visualization of the relationship between three variables is possible in a three-dimensional scatter plot, a direct extension of the principles used in two dimensions to a three-dimensional data cube. Each of the dimensions of the cube corresponds to a variable, and the observations are shown as a point cloud in three dimensions (of course, projected onto the two-dimensional plane of our screen).</p>
<p>This device is invoked as <strong>Explore &gt; 3D Scatter Plot</strong> from the menu, or by selecting the corresponding icon on the toolbar, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscattericon">54</a> (the third from the right in the EDA group).</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 54: 3D Scatter Plot toolbar icon
</p>
</div>
<p>The choice of this icon brings up a variable selection dialog for the variables corresponding to the <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> dimensions. We stay with the same variables as before: <strong>kids2000</strong>, <strong>pubast00</strong>, and <strong>rent2002</strong>, as in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscattervars">55</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The default 3D scatter plot in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscatter1">56</a> shows the data cube with the y-axis as vertical, and the z and x-axes as horizontal.</p>

<p>The data cube can be re-sized by keeping the control key pressed and moving the pointer up (zoom out) or down (zoom in). It can also be rotated by means of the pointer. In addition, the controls on the left-hand side of the view allow for the projection of the point cloud onto a given two-dimensional pane, and the construction of a selection box by checking the relevant boxes and/or moving the slider bar.</p>
<p>For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscatter2">57</a>, the cube has been zoomed in and the axes rotated such that Z is now vertical. With the <strong>Project to X-Y</strong> box checked on the left, a 2-dimensional scatter plot is projected onto the X-Y plane.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 57: 3D Scatter Plot zoom and project
</p>
</div>
<p>Selection in the three dimensional plot (or, rather, its two-dimensional projection) is a little tricky and takes some practice. The selection can be done either manually, by pressing down the command key while moving the pointer, or by using the guides under the selection check box.</p>
<p>Checking the box next to <strong>Select</strong> creates a small red selection cube in the graph. This can be moved around with the command key pressed, or can be moved and resized by using the controls to the left. The first set of controls (to the left) move the box along the matching dimension, e.g., up or down the X values for larger or smaller values of the percentage households with kids, and the same for the other two variables. The control to the right changes the size of the box in the corresponding dimension (e.g., larger along the x dimension). The combination of these controls moves the box around to select observation points, with the selected points colored yellow.</p>
<p>For example, in the graph shown in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscatbrush">58</a>, the selection box has been moved to the upper end of the Z dimension (high rent), and the low end of both X and Y (low percent children and low assistance). The selected observations are highlighted in yellow in the data cube.</p>

<p>The linking feature of GeoDa selectes these same five observations in the map, as in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscatmap">59</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:3dscatbubble">60</a>, GeoDa also shows these same observations in the bubble chart (from the previous section), confirming the association between low percentage kids, low assistance and high rent that we found earlier.</p>

<p>Similar to what we observed for the bubble chart, the 3D scatter plot is most useful for small to medium sized data sets. For larger numbers of observations, the point cloud quickly becomes overwhelming and is no longer effective for visualization.</p>

<section id="multivariate-eda-parallel-coordinate-plot-and-conditional-plots" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Multivariate EDA: Parallel Coordinate Plot and Conditional Plots</h2>
<p>Once we move beyond three variables, it becomes difficult to visualize the actual multi-dimensional cloud plot that corresponds to the observations. Instead, we need to resort to creative ways to reduce the dimensionality to something we can show in a standard two-dimensional view. Two methods that take a different approach to this problem are the parallel coordinate plot (PCP) and conditional plots.</p>
<section id="parallel-coordinate-plot-pcp" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Parallel Coordinate Plot (PCP)</h3>
<p>The parallel coordinate plot or PCP is designed to visually identify clusters and patterns in a multi-dimensional variable space. Originally suggested by <span class="citation" data-cites="Inselberg:85 InselbergDimsdale:90">Inselberg (<a href="#ref-Inselberg:85">1985</a>; see also Inselberg and Dimsdale <a href="#ref-InselbergDimsdale:90">1990</a>)</span>, it has become a main feature in many visual data mining frameworks <span class="citation" data-cites="Wegman:90 WegmanDorfman:03">(e.g., Wegman <a href="#ref-Wegman:90">1990</a>; Wegman and Dorfman <a href="#ref-WegmanDorfman:03">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In a PCP, each variable is represented as a (parallel) axis, and each observation consists of a line that connects points on the axes. Clusters are identified as groups of lines (i.e., observations) that follow a similar path. This is equivalent to points that are close together in multidimensional variable space. Unlike the latter, which can only be visualized for up to three dimensions (e.g., in the 3D scatter plot), the PCP can be applied to a large number of variables. The only limitation is human perception and screen real estate.</p>
<p>Outliers in a PCP are lines that show a very different pattern from the rest, similar to outlying points in a multi-dimensional cloud.</p>
<p>The PCP functionality is invoked from the menu as <strong>Explore &gt; Parallel Coordinate Plot</strong>, or by means of the PCP toolbar icon, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpicon">61</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:pcpicon"></span>
<img src="pics2/10_212_pcpicon.png" alt="PCP toolbar icon" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 61: PCP toolbar icon
</p>
</div>
<p>In the familiar way, clicking on this icon brings up a variable selection dialog. In the same manner as for the scatter plot matrix, we move variables from the left column to the right <strong>Include</strong> column using the arrows (or by double clicking on the variable name). In our example, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpvars">62</a>, we will use the same three variables as before, <strong>kids2000</strong>, <strong>rent2002</strong>, and <strong>pubast00</strong>, as well as a fourth, <strong>yrhom02</strong>, the average number of years lived in the current residence in 2002.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 62: PCP variable selection
</p>
</div>
<p>Each line in the plot corresponds to one observation. The connected points are the values taken for that observation for each of the variables on the axes. The default PCP in GeoDa has the basic green colors, similar to the <strong>Themeless</strong> base map, as in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpdefault">63</a>. Also, some descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) are listed next to each of the axes (this is the default, but it can be changed with the <strong>Display</strong> option).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:pcpdefault"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 63: Default PCP
</p>
</div>
<p>The options for the PCP include all the standard features we have seen before. In the same manner as for the bubble chart, we also have the choice of <strong>Classification Themes</strong>. This allows for all of the themes available for choropleth maps to be applied to the variable listed at the top in the PCP. Changing the color theme may make it a little easier to compare the pattern of the observations for one variable to the relative order of those observations for other variables, although colors are notoriously poor in distinguishing subtle variation in values.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Therefore, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpthemes">64</a>, the default of <strong>Themeless</strong> is preferred. We will revisit the classifications in the discussion of the <strong>Map</strong> functionality.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:pcpthemes"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 64: PCP options
</p>
</div>
<p>It often makes sense to change the order of the axes (variables) to bring out patterns of clustering (or outliers) more clearly. This is accomplished by dragging the circle associated with each axis to a different location. For example, in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpmove1">65</a>, we drag the circle associated with <strong>pubast00</strong> up to move it to the second spot, above <strong>rent2002</strong>.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The resulting PCP in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpmove2">66</a> shows more clearly how the low and high values for <strong>kids2000</strong> and <strong>pubast00</strong> align.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Just like the scatter plot, the PCP can be <strong>brushed</strong>. In Figure <a href="#fig:pcpbrush1">67</a>, using a rectangular selection shape, the five lowest values for <strong>kids2000</strong> are selected. The pattern that results (only the selected observations, or lines, are highlighted in the graph), shows how these observations track very closely for the four variables considered here. This is a typical pattern for a <strong>visual cluster</strong> detected in the PCP. The rectangle can be moved along the axis for <strong>kids2000</strong> to see how other clusters may reveal themselves. Alternatively, the <em>brush</em> can be created on any of the other axes to proceed in a similar way.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 67: Brushing the PCP
</p>
</div>
<p>The selection in the PCP is immediately linked to the other open views. For example, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:pcpmap">68</a>, the five selected observations are sub-boroughs located in Manhattan, as we have already seen before.</p>

<p>Similar to what holds for the other graphs, the brushing process can be initiated in any of the other open views, such as the map, histogram, box plot, scatter plot, bubble chart or 3D scatter plot.</p>

<section id="conditional-plots" class="level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Conditional Plots</h3>
<p>Conditional plots, also known as facet graphs or Trellis graphs <span class="citation" data-cites="Beckeretal:96">(Becker, Cleveland, and Shyu <a href="#ref-Beckeretal:96">1996</a>)</span>, provide a means to assess interactions between more than two variables. Multiple graphs or maps are constructed for different subsets of the observations, obtained as a result of <em>conditioning</em> on the value of two variables. GeoDa supports conditional maps, histograms and scatter plots.</p>
<p>Each of the three conditional plots is started from the <strong>Conditional Plot</strong> icon on the toolbar, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:condploticon">69</a>. This brings up a list that provides three types of plot options. Alternatively, the same can be accomplished from the menu, by means of <strong>Explore &gt; Conditional Plot</strong>, followed by the choice of <strong>Map</strong>, <strong>Histogram</strong> or <strong>Scatter Plot</strong> (note that the conditional map functionality can also be started from the map menu, as <strong>Map &gt; Conditional Map</strong>). In what follows, we will focus on the conditional scatter plot, as in Figure <a href="#fig:condplotoption">70</a>. This allows the interaction among four variables to be considered simultaneously.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:condploticon"></span>

</div>
<p>The four variables required are selected in the variables selection dialog shown in Figure <a href="#fig:condplotvars">71</a>. Not only are there the conditioning variables for the x and y axes that need to be chosen, but also the two variables for the scatter plot itself. In our example, we have taken <strong>hhsiz00</strong> (median household size in 2000), <strong>yrhom02</strong> (average number of years lived in current residence, for 2002) as the two conditioning variables. The scatter plot is constructed with <strong>kids2000</strong> (% households with kids under 18 in 2000) on the x-axis and <strong>pubast00</strong> (% households receiving public assistance in 2000) on the y-axis.</p>

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>The default plot consists of a 3 x 3 arrangement. In our example in Figure <a href="#fig:condplot3x3">72</a>, the subsetting is too fine grained for 55 observations, since several cells have only minimal observations (e.g., 2, 3 and 4).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:condplot3x3"></span>
<img src="pics2/11_226_condscat3x3.png" alt="3x3 Conditional Scatter Plot" width="80%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 72: 3x3 Conditional Scatter Plot
</p>
</div>
<p>The options menu provides a way to change the number of categories as well as the break points. The <strong>Vertical Bins Breaks</strong> and <strong>Horizontal Bins Breaks</strong> contain all the standard interval conventions (more about this when we discuss mapping), as well as the possibility to create custom cut-off points.</p>
<p>In our example, illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:binbreaks">73</a>, we switch from a 3x3 setup to a 2x2 arrangement by selecting the median (<strong>Quantile &gt; 2</strong>) as the break point for each of the conditioning variables.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> More precisely, a breakpoint is chosen that splits the number of observations into two equal parts (as close as possible). However, since the median can itself correspond to an observation (for an uneven number of observations, as is the case in our example), the cut-off value shown in the graph can be slightly different from the actual median.</p>
<p>For example, the median for <strong>hhsiz00</strong> (e.g., as obtained from the descriptive statistics listed with a box plot) is 2.7176, whereas the cut-off value shown for the horizontal axis of the graph is 2.703. In addition, when there are many tied observations, the break points are chosen such that the resulting categories are as close as possible to the specified requirements. In any event, the breaks can also be set explicitly by means of the <strong>Custom Breaks</strong> option (see the discussion of the map functionality).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:binbreaks"></span>

<p>By default, a linear fit is shown through the scatter plots (<strong>Show Linear Smoother</strong>), and for each plot, axes tick points (<strong>View &gt; Display Axes Scale Values</strong>) and the slope value (<strong>View &gt; Display Slope Values</strong>) are displayed by default. These settings are illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:condfit">74</a>. As in the scatter plot matrix, the regression slopes are highlighted as significant by means of one (p &lt; 0.05) or two asterisks (p &lt; 0.01).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:condfit"></span>

</div>
<p>The result in Figure <a href="#fig:condfit">74</a> suggest a positive and significant slope between the number of kids and the degree of public assistance for those neighborhoods with more residential transition (smaller number of years lived in residence), as shown in the two graphs at the bottom. The slope is almost four times steeper in neighborhoods with larger household size (lower-right graph). However, the relationship is not significant for the more residentially stable neighborhoods (number of years lived in residence above the median), irrespective of the household size (top two graphs).</p>
<p>Finally, the options also allow for a LOWESS smoother to be applied to the scatter plot points (by checking <strong>Show LOWESS Smoother</strong> in the options). For example, with the bandwidth set to 0.40 (after adjusting the bandwith with <strong>Edit LOWESS Parameters</strong>), this results in the graph shown in Figure <a href="#fig:condlowess">75</a>. We again see a more or less linear relationship in the bottom two scatter plots, but much more erratic behavior in the top ones. This confirms the lack of significance we found for the linear fit.</p>
