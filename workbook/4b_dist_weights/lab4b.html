<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this Chapter, we will continue to deal with the spatial weights functionality in GeoDa,
but now we will focus on weights that use the notion of distance. Intrinsically, this
is most appropriate for point layers, but we will see that it can readily be
generalized to polygons as well.</p>
<p>We will initially use a data set with point locations of house sales for Cleveland, OH,
but later return to our U.S. county Homicides data to illustrate the polygon case.</p>
<p>We will compute the distance between points to create distance-band weights, as well as k-nearest neighbor weights. We will examine the weights characteristics and pay particular attention to the issue of neighborless locations, or <em>isolates</em>. We also
consider generalizing the
concept of contiguity to points (using Thiessen polygons), and the notion of distance-based weights for polygons (using their centroids to compute the distances).</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
<p>To begin, we will use a data set that contains the location and sales price of 205 homes in a core area of Cleveland, OH for the fourth quarter of 2015.
The data set is included as one of the Center for Spatial Data Science example
data sets and can be downloaded from
<a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab//clev_sls_154_core/">Cleveland Home Sales (2015)</a>.
This yields a folder with four shape files with file name <strong>clev_sls_154_core</strong> and
the usual four file extensions (shp, shx, dbf and prj).</p>
<p>We get started by clearing the previous project and dropping the file <strong>clev_sls_154_core.shp</strong> into the <strong>Drop files here</strong> rectangle of the connect to data source dialog. A themeless base map is shown
in Figure <a href="#fig:home1">1</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:home1"></span>

</p>
</div>
<div id="customizing-a-point-map" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Customizing a point map</h4>
<p>To make this look a little nicer, we make three minor modifications. First, we add a base map using the
corresponding toolbar icon and pick <strong>Nokia Day</strong>. The transparency may need some adjustment to
make the points easier to see (use <strong>Change Map Transparency</strong> from the base map icon options menu).</p>
<p>Next, we change the color of the points themselves (actually, drawn as tiny circles). This is one of the options in the legend panel of the map. Right click on the green box to the left
of <strong>(205)</strong> and choose <strong>Color for Category</strong>, as in Figure <a href="#fig:cat1">2</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:cat1"></span>
<img src="pics4b/0_362_colorforcategory.png" alt="Set color for category" width="25%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 2: Set color for category
</p>
</div>
<p>In our example, we turned the circles to black, which results in the base map
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:base1">3</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:base1"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Cleveland home sales point map
</p>
</div>
<p>A third minor adjustment is to change the way selected and unselected points are
displayed. The default is to use transparency to distinguish them, but for points this
often does not provide a clear distinction, in the sense that the unselected points
may be hard to see. Instead, we go back to the <em>old</em> way of highlighting selected observations
in GeoDa, which is to use a different color.</p>
<p>We set this option in the <strong>System</strong> tab of the <strong>GeoDa Preferences Setup</strong>. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:color1">4</a>, the first item under <strong>Maps</strong> pertains to the way in which map selections are highlighted. The default is to have the check box <strong>off</strong>, but we change that so that the box is checked.</p>

<p>A selection of points (locations) in the map is now shown as <em>red</em>, whereas the
unselected points remain in black, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:redselect">5</a>.</p>

<p>The points considered in our example are contained within an arbitrary rectangular selection taken from the full set
of home sales for that period. We are now ready to proceed with spatial weights derived
from a point layer.</p>

<h2>Distance-Band Weights</h2>
<div id="concepts" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concepts</h3>
<div id="distance-metric" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Distance metric</h4>
<p>The core input into the determination of a neighbor relation for distance-based
spatial weights is a formal measure of distance, or a distance <em>metric</em>.
The most familiar special case is the <em>Euclidean</em> or straight line
distance, <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij}\)</span>, as the crow flies:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{equation*}
d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_{i} - x_{j})^{2} + (y_{i} - y_{j})^{2}}, 
\end{equation*}\]</span>
for two points <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, with respective coordinates <span class="math inline">\((x_{i},y_{i})\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\((x_{j},y_{j})\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="great-circle-distance" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Great circle distance</h4>
<p>Euclidean inter-point distances
are only meaningful when the coordinates are recorded on
a plane, i.e., for projected points.</p>
<p>In practice,
one often works with unprojected points, expressed as
degrees of latitude and longitude, in which case using a straight
line distance measure is inappropriate, since it ignores the curvature
of the earth. This is especially the case for longer distances, such
as from the East Coast to the West Coast in the U.S.</p>
<p>The proper distance measure in this case is the so-called
<em>arc distance</em> or <em>great circle distance</em>. This
takes the latitude and longitude in decimal degrees as input
into a conversion formula.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Decimal degrees are obtained
from the degree-minute-second value as degrees +
minutes/60 + seconds/3600.</p>
<p>The latitude and longitude in
decimal degrees are converted into radians as:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Lat}_r &amp;=&amp; (\mbox{Lat}_d - 90) * \pi/180\\
\mbox{Lon}_r &amp;=&amp; \mbox{Lon}_d * \pi/180,
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
where the subscripts <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> refer respectively to decimal
degrees and radians, and <span class="math inline">\(\pi = 3.14159 \dots\)</span>.
With <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \mbox{Lon} = \mbox{Lon}_{r(j)} - \mbox{Lon}_{r(i)}\)</span>, the
expression for the arc distance is:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
d_{ij} &amp;=&amp; \mbox{R} * \arccos [ \cos ( \Delta \mbox{Lon} )
     * \sin \mbox{Lat}_{r(i)} *
 \sin \mbox{Lat}_{r(j)} )\\
  &amp;&amp;+ \cos \mbox{Lat}_{r(i)} * \cos \mbox{Lat}_{r(j)} ],
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
or, equivalently:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{eqnarray*}
d_{ij} &amp;=&amp; \mbox{R} * \arccos [ \cos ( \Delta \mbox{Lon} )
     * \cos \mbox{Lat}_{r(i)} *
 \cos \mbox{Lat}_{r(j)} )\\
   &amp;&amp;+ \sin \mbox{Lat}_{r(i)} * \sin \mbox{Lat}_{r(j)} ],
\end{eqnarray*}\]</span>
where R is the radius of the earth. In GeoDa, the arc distance is obtained in
miles with R = 3959, and in kilometers with R = 6371.</p>
<p>These
calculated distance values are only approximate, since the radius
of the earth is taken at the equator. A more precise measure would
take into account the actual latitude at which the distance
is measured. In addition, the earth’s shape is much
more complex than a sphere, but the approximation serves our purposes.</p>
</div>
<div id="distance-band-weights-1" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Distance-band weights</h4>
<p>The most straightforward spatial weights matrix constructed from a
distance measure is obtained when <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> are considered neighbors whenever <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>
falls within a critical <em>distance band</em> from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. More precisely, <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} = 1\)</span>
when <span class="math inline">\(d_{ij} \le \delta\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(w_{ij} = 0\)</span> otherwise, where <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is
a preset critical distance cutoff.</p>
<p>In order to avoid isolates (islands) that would result from too
stringent a critical distance, the distance must be chosen such
that each
location has at least one neighbor. Such a distance conforms
to a <em>max-min</em> criterion, i.e., it is the largest of the
nearest neighbor distances.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>In practice, the max-min criterion often leads to too many neighbors
for locations that are somewhat clustered, since the critical
distance is determined by the points that are furthest apart.
This problem
frequently occurs
when the density of the points is uneven across
the data set, such as when some of the points are clustered
and others more spread out. We revisit this problem in the illustrations
below.</p>
<p>Further technical details on distance-based spatial weights are contained Chapters 3 and 4 of <span class="citation">Anselin and Rey (<a href="#ref-AnselinRey:14">2014</a>)</span>, although the software illustrations are for an earlier GeoDa interface design.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="creating-distance-band-weights" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Creating distance-band weights</h3>
<p>As we did for contiguity weights, we invoke the <strong>Weights Manager</strong> and click on the <strong>Create</strong> button to get the process started. In the <strong>Weights File Creation</strong> interface, after specifying the ID variable (<strong>unique_id</strong>), we focus on the right-most button, <strong>Distance Weight</strong>. This generates the dialog for
the three distance weight options: <strong>Distance band</strong>, <strong>K-Nearest neighbors</strong>, and <strong>Adaptive kernel</strong>.
In this Chapter, we focus on the first two options.</p>
<p>Distance band weights are initiated by selecting the <strong>Distance band</strong> button in the interface, as
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:distanceband">6</a>. This is also the default option. The max-min distance (largest nearest neighbor distance) is given in the box next to
<strong>Specify bandwidth</strong>, in units appropriate for the projection used. In our example, these are feet.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:distanceband"></span>
<img src="pics4b/1_clev_distanceband.png" alt="Distance band default setting" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 6: Distance band default setting
</p>
</div>
<p>Note the importance of the <strong>Distance metric</strong>, highlighted in Figure <a href="#fig:distanceband">6</a>. Since our data is projected, it is appropriate to use <strong>Euclidean</strong> (straight line) distance. However, many data sets come in simple latitude-longitude, for which a great circle distance (or arc distance) must be used instead. We will revisit this shortly.</p>
<p>The critical distance for our point data is about 3598 feet, or roughly 0.7 miles. This is the distance that ensures that each point (house sale) has at least one neighbor. After clicking on the <strong>Create</strong> button and specifying a file name, such as <strong>clev_sls_154_cored_d</strong>
(the GWT file extension is added automatically), the new weights and their
summary properties are listed in the <strong>Weights Manager</strong>, as in Figure <a href="#fig:dweights1">7</a>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:dweights1"></span>
<img src="pics4b/1_clev_d_weightmanager.png" alt="Distance weights in weight manager" width="40%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 7: Distance weights in weight manager
</p>
</div>
<p>An important aspect of the metadata in the weights manager is the <strong>threshold value</strong>. This
information will also be included in any <strong>Project File</strong> that is saved. This is the only reliable way to remember which distance cut-off was used for the distance bands in the weights.</p>
</div>
<div id="gwt-file" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>GWT file</h3>
<p>Distance-based weights are saved in files with a <strong>GWT</strong> file extension. This format,
illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:gwtformat">8</a>, is slightly different from the GAL format used for contiguity weights. It was first introduced in SpaceStat in 1995, and later adopted by R spdep and other software packages. The header line is the same as for GAL files, but each pair of neighbors is listed, with the ID of the observation, the ID of its neighbor and the distance that separates them. This distance is currently only included for informational purposes, since GeoDa does not use the actual distance value in any statistical operations (spatial weights are also row-standardized by default).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:gwtformat"></span>

</div>
</div>
<div id="weights-characteristics" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Weights characteristics</h3>
<p>In the same way as for contiguity weights, we can assess the characteristics of
distance-based weights by means of the <strong>Connectivity Histogram</strong>, the <strong>Connectivity
Map</strong>, and the <strong>Connectivity Graph</strong>, available through the buttons at the bottom of the weights manager.</p>
<div id="connectivity-histogram" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Connectivity histogram</h4>
<p>The shape of the connectivity histogram for distance-band weights is typically very different from that of contiguity-based weights (as in any histogram, we can bring up descriptive statistics through the
<strong>View &gt; Display Statistics</strong> option). As illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:disthistogram">9</a>, we see a much larger range in the number of neighbors, as well as extremes, with some observations having only one neighbor, and others having 32.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:disthistogram"></span>
<img src="pics4b/1_clev_d_histogram.png" alt="Connectivity histogram -- default distance band" width="60%" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 9: Connectivity histogram – default distance band
</p>
</div>
<p>We also observe these descriptive statistics in the property list shown in Figure <a href="#fig:dweights1">7</a>.
Compared to contiguity weights, the mean (12.64) and median (13.00) number of neighbors are much
higher, and the matrix is also much denser (% non-zero = 6.17%).</p>
<p>The range in the number of neighbors is directly related to the spatial distribution of the points. Locations that are somewhat isolated will drive the determination of the largest nearest neighbor cut-off point (their nearest neighbor distance will be large), whereas dense clusters of locations will encompass many neighbors using this large cut-off distance.</p>
</div>
<div id="finding-the-locations-separated-by-the-max-min-distance" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Finding the locations separated by the max-min distance</h4>
<p>In the Cleveland example, we can examine the GWT file to find the observation pair separated by the critical distance cut-off (3598). As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:maxdist">10</a>, this turns out to be the observation pair with unique_id 11359 and 10014.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:maxdist"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 10: Cut off distance in GWT file
</p>
</div>
<p>In the Table, a selection of observation with unique_id 11359 will result in the corresponding
location to be highlighted in red in the
point map, as indicated with the pointer in
Figure <a href="#fig:maxminlocation">11</a>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p>We now open the <strong>Connectivity Map</strong>, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:distconnmap">12</a>. Since this map is a regular themeless map, we can customize
it in the same way as the original point map by adding a base layer (Nokia day) and changing the
color category to black. As the current selection,
the point with <strong>unique_id</strong> 11359 will be highlighted in red. With the pointer
hovering over the selected point, the status bar of the connectivity map
will show the selected observation (11359) and its one neighbor (10114, in black), as highlighted in

<p>The unequal distribution of the neighbor cardinality in distance-band weights is often an undesirable feature.

<p>The pattern shown in Figure <a href="#fig:dconngraph">15</a> highlights how the connectivity divides the points into
two interconnected subgraphs and two pairs of points. The different sub-networks have no connection between them. In Figure <a href="#fig:dconngraph">15</a>, the pointer is centered on

<p>For example, say we want to use 1500 ft. as the distance band. After typing in that value in the dialog,

<h4>How to deal with isolates</h4>
<p>Since the isolated observations are not included in the spatial weights (in effect, the corresponding row in the spatial weights matrix consists of zeros), they are not accounted for in any spatial analysis, such as tests for spatial autocorrelation, or spatial regression. For all practical purposes, they should be removed from such analysis. However, they are fine
to be included in a traditional <em>non-spatial</em> data analysis.</p>
<p>Ignoring isolates may cause problems in the calculation of spatially lagged variables, or measures of local spatial autocorrelation. By construction, the spatially
lagged variable will be zero, which may suggest spurious correlations.</p>
<p>Alternatives where isolates are avoided by design are the K-nearest neighbor weights and
contiguity weights constructed from the Thiessen polygons for the points. They are discussed next.</p>

<div id="k-nearest-neighbor-weights" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>K-Nearest Neighbor Weights</h2>
<div id="concept" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>As mentioned, an alternative type of distance-based spatial weights that avoids the problem
of isolates are <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbor weights. In contrast
to the distance band, this is not a symmetric relation. The fact that B is the nearest
neighbor to A does not imply that A is the nearest neighbor to B. There may be another point
C that is actually closer to B than A. This asymmetry can cause problems in analyses that
depend on the instrinsic symmetry of the weights (e.g., some algorithms to estimate spatial
regression models). One solution is to replace the original weights matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{W}\)</span> by
<span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{W + W&#39;})/2\)</span>, which is symmetric by construction.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> GeoDa currently does not implement
this approach.</p>
<p>A potential issue with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbor weights is the
occurrence of ties, i.e., when more than one location <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> has the
same distance from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. A number of solutions exist to break
the tie, from randomly selecting one of the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th order

is much sparser than the distance-band weights (2.93% compared to 6.17%).</p>
<p>Again, we can also use the connectivity histogram and the connectivity map to inspect the neighbor characteristics of the observations. However, in this case, the histogram doesn’t make much sense, since all observations have the same number of neighbors (by construction), as shown

<h4>KNN and distance</h4>
<p>One drawback of the k-nearest neighbor approach is that it ignores the distances involved. The first k neighbors are selected, irrespective of how near or how far they may be. This suggests a notion of distance decay that is not absolute, but relative, in the sense of intervening opportunities (e.g., you consider the two closest grocery stores, irrespective of how far they may be).</p>
<p>This can be illustrated in the Cleveland example by selecting an observation in the western
part of the map, where the house sales are densely distributed in space. With the pointer on
one of the circles in the connectivity map, we distinguish six black circles close by, as
shown in Figure <a href="#fig:k6close">26</a>.</p>

<p>By contrast, if we move to the eastern part of the data set and similarly select an

<div id="generalizing-the-concept-of-contiguity" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Generalizing the Concept of Contiguity</h2>
<p>In GeoDa, the concept of contiguity can be generalized to point layers by converting
the latter to a tessellation, specifically Thiessen polygons. Queen or rook contiguity
weights can then be created for the polygons, in the usual way.</p>
<p>Similarly, the concepts of distance-band weights and k-nearest neighbor weights can be
generalized to polygon layers. The layers are represented by their central points and
the standard distance computations are applied.</p>
<p>These operations can be carried out explicitly, by actually creating a separate Thiessen polygon
layer or centroid point layer, and subsequently loading it into GeoDa as a new project.
Alternatively, the computations happen <em>under the hood</em>, in the sense that it is not
necessary to create a separate layer. In this way, it is possible to use the weights
manager to create contiguity weights for points or distance weights for polygons directly
in the <strong>Weights File Creation</strong> dialog.</p>
<p>We briefly consider these options.</p>
<div id="contiguity-based-weights-for-points" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Contiguity-based weights for points</h3>
<div id="thiessen-polygons" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Thiessen polygons</h4>
<p>An alternative solution to deal with the problem of the uneven distribution of neighbor cardinality for distance-band weights is to compute a measure of contiguity. This is accomplished by turning the points into Thiessen polygons. These are also referred to as Voronoi diagrams or Delaunay triangulations.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>In general terms, a Thiessen polygon is a
tessellation (a way to divide an area into regular subareas) that encloses all locations
that are closer to the central point than to any other point. In economic geography, this
is a (simplistic) notion of a market area, in the sense that all consumers in the polygon
would patronize the seller located at the central point. The polygons are constructed
by combining lines perpendicular at the midpoint of a line that connects a point to its nearest neighbors.
From this, the most compact polygon is created.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-thiessen-polygons-from-a-point-layer" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Creating Thiessen polygons from a point layer</h4>
<p>In any point map, the tessellation is invoked as an option, by right-clicking on the map. Similar
to the setup for <strong>Shape Centers</strong>, <strong>Thiessen Polygons</strong> gives a choice between simply
displaying the polygons over the point layer, or saving them as a separater
layer, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:thiessenoption">28</a>.</p>
<p>There
is a third option (greyed out in the example below) that applies to situations where
multiple points share the same location (e.g., appartments in the same high rise).
GeoDa has an option to save the information for the duplicate points to a
table.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h4>Contiguity weights for Thiessen polygons</h4>
<p>When selecting rook or queen contiguity in the <strong>Contiguity Weight</strong> panel of the
weights file creation dialog, the Thiessen polygons are constructed in the background
and the contiguity criteria applied to them. For example, for our Cleveland point data, we can create
a queen contiguity weights file in the standard way (e.g., as <strong>clev_sls_154_core_q</strong>). The
file name subsequently shows up in the weights manager list, as

<p>The descriptive statistics in the properties list as well as the associated connectivity histogram illustrate why this approach may be a useful alternative to distance-band or k-nearest neighbor weights.

<p>The histogram represents a much more symmetric and compact distribution of the neighbor cardinalities, very similar to the typical shape of the histogram for first order contiguity between polygons. The median number of neighbors is 6 and the average 5.6, with a limited spread around these values. In many instances where the point distribution is highly uneven, this approach provides a useful compromise between the distance-band and the k-nearest neighbors.</p>
<p>This is further illustrated by the connectivity graph for the queen contiguity, shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:queenptsgraph">32</a>. The pointer over point with unique_id 40295 shows this location having
six neighbors, compared to only one in Figure <a href="#fig:dconngraph">15</a> for the default distance band

<h3>Distance-based weights for polygons</h3>
<p>To illustrate the application of distance-based weights to polygons, the current project
needs to be cleared and the U.S. county homicide file (<strong>natregimes</strong>) loaded, either
as a shape file (<strong>natregimes.shp</strong>, without any weights information), or from a
previously created project
file (<strong>natregimes.gda</strong>, with the weights information).</p>
<p>As we have seen before, the polygon layer has a series of <strong>Shape Center</strong> options to
add the centroid or mean center information to the data table, display those points on the
map, or save them as a separate point layer.</p>
<p>In order to create distance weights for polygons, such as the U.S. counties, there is no need
to explicitly save or display the centroids. The calculation happens in the background, whenever a distance option is chosen in the weights file creation dialog.</p>
<p>We proceed as usual, and select the <strong>Distance Weight</strong> option in the <strong>Weights File Creation</strong>
dialog. With
<strong>fipsno</strong> as the ID variable and <strong>Distance Band</strong> as the type of weight, the <strong>Specify bandwidth</strong>
box will show a cut-off distance of 1.465776, as in Figure <a href="#fig:degreedistance">33</a>.</p>

<p>However, this distance cut-off is for the default setting of <strong>Euclidean

decimal degrees (i.e., the coordinates are unprojected). Consequently, the use of a straight line Euclidean distance is inappropriate (at least, for larger distances). Instead, the great circle distance or arc distance needs to be computed. So far, we have only considered Euclidean distance (the default), but the drop down list in the weights file creation interface also includes <strong>Arc Distance</strong> (in miles or in kilometers), as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:arcdistanceoption">34</a>.</p>

points with different densities. From the property list in Figure <a href="#fig:arcweights">36</a>, we see that the range of weights goes from 1 to 85. The connectivity

<p>Clearly, the cut-off distance
has major consequences for the smaller counties east of the Mississippi. As an illustration, we
select the right-most bar in the connectivity histogram, the single location that has 85 neighbors.
Checking the linked location in the table reveals this selection refers to Jessamine county, KY, with fipsno 21113.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> We
can now identify this county in the <strong>Connectivity Graph</strong>. As shown in Figure <a href="#fig:conngraph85">40</a>,
we find that the roughly 91 mile range selects the 85 small counties that neighbor Jessamin county.</p>

<p>In practice, policy or theoretical considerations often dictate a given distance band (e.g., commuting distance). As we have seen, we need to be cautious before we uncritically translate these criteria into distance bands. Especially when the areal units in question are of widely varying sizes, there will be problems with the distribution of the neighbor cardinalities. In addition, isolates will result when the distance is insufficiently large.</p>
