<h2>
	Getting Started: Input, Mapping and Table Operations</h2>
<p><b><a name="data">What characteristics do my data have to have?</a></b></p>
<p>To analyze your data in GeoDa, they should be (information about <a href="#limits">data size</a> and <a href="#isle">islands</a>):</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		In shape file (.shp) format (shape files are native to <a href="http://www.esri.com/">ESRI&#39;s ArcView/ArcGIS</a> software. If data are formatted for <a href="http://www.mapinfo.com/">MapInfo</a> or other programs, they have to be converted or they can be imported into GeoDa from ASCII or dbf format for <a href="/node/381">points</a> and <a href="/node/383#text">polygons</a>);</li>
	<li>
		Continuously distributed (not categorically)</li>
	<li>
		Refer to discrete areal units (as opposed to sample or event points)</li>
	<li>
		Have no <a href="#miss">missing values</a>.</li>
	<li>
		Cross-sectional data (as opposed to panel data)</li>
	<li>
		Contain a unique ID (if no unique ID exists, it can easily be added in a spreadsheet or GIS program; <a href="/node/404#load">more information</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="color">What options are there to change colors?</a></b></p>
<p>Mostly through right-clicking, users can change the color of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		a map&#39;s default color (in regular and <a href="/node/390#movie">movie</a> format)</li>
	<li>
		the legend categories (click on the legend color you want to change)</li>
	<li>
		the shading color of the cross-hatched selection, and</li>
	<li>
		the background color (e.g., useful for <a href="/node/390#boxplot">box plots</a> and <a href="/node/390#gmoran">Moran scatter plots</a> when <a href="/node/390#link">linking &amp; brushing</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="screen">Taking a screenshot of your GeoDa output</a></b></p>
<p>GeoDa allows you to export your map or object and legend as separate images: Right-click on the map, go to <b>Save</b> <b>Image as</b> and save it as a .bmp file. Right-click on the legend and choose <b>Copy legend to clipboard</b>. In another program, you can add these two images together, e.g., by inserting them into a 2-column table.</p>
<p>This process is a bit tedious and only includes one GeoDa window. Another way to capture your GeoDa output is to take a screenshot. A simple way to do so is to select Alt-PrtScn on your keyboard and paste the screenshort into another program. For fancier screenshot options, several free and commercial screenshot programs are available (for details, see the <a href="/openspace/2004-May/subject.html" target="_blank">May 2004 Openspace archives</a> on exporting maps and legends).</p>
<p>GeoDa currently does not contain the option to save all of your visual output as a project and return to it later. Taking a screenshot can serve as an informal archive of your visual output.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="layer">Can I load more than one layer in GeoDa?</a></b></p>
<p>Since GeoDa is not designed as a substitute for a <a href="/node/390#gis">GIS</a>, it does not incorporate the option to work with multiple <a href="/node/390#layer">layers</a>. However, it is possible to add a layer to compare shape files after they have been transformed (e.g., from polygons to points or vice versa). However, only the top layer is active. For instance, if the <a href="/node/390#centralpt">central points</a> of a polygon file are added as a top layer and a quantile map is created, the quantile map colors are applied to the points while the base layer maintains its default color.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="miss">What to do with missing values?</a></b></p>
<p>GeoDa cannot deal with missing values - it will fill blank fields with zeros or treat values such as 99, -1, etc. as observed. There is no easy solution to this problem. Some options include excluding missing observations, resaving your shape file for only those areas without missing values or interpolating missing values (care needs to be taken that this interpolation is not based on the values of immediate neighbors, otherwise <a href="/node/390#sa">spatial autocorrelation</a> is introduced by design). More information on <a href="/openspace/2004-March/000171.html">Openspace</a>.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="panel">I have space-time data - what to do?</a></b></p>
<p>GeoDa is designed for cross-sectional data. There are a few limited applications of time data in GeoDa. For instance, you can use the bivariate <a href="/node/377">global Moran scatterplot and local Moran (LISA) maps</a> to associate the neighboring values at one time period to the core location of another time period.Other free exploratory spatial data analysis tools exist to analyze space-time data, e.g., <a href="http://geodacenter.asu.edu/software" target="_self">Space-Time Analysis of Regional Systems (STARS)</a>.</p>
<p>For more information on space-time data in a modelling context, see Openspace (e.g., the spatial panel thread from <a href="/openspace/2004-March/thread.html#160">March 2004</a> and the August 2004 threads on <a href="/openspace/2004-August/000328.html">&quot;error correction models with spatial dependence&quot;</a> and <a href="/openspace/2004-August/000332.html">&quot;spatial poisson&quot;</a>).</p>

<h2>
	Exploratory (Spatial) Data Analysis</h2>
<p><b><a name="limits">Are there dataset size limits for doing ESDA?</a></b></p>
<p>The primary limit to the number of observations in <a href="/node/390#esda">ESDA</a> is visual and <a href="/node/386#specs">hardware-dependent</a>: For instance, unless you are using a very large screen to project your results, you will not be able to visually discern patterns in one million points. You can run regressions and do ESDA in GeoDa with large datasets (several hundred thousand; depending on your hardware and the <a href="/openspace/2005-August/000523.html">density of your weights matrix</a>) - it is computationally possible but you often run out of screen real estate when it comes to interpreting the results visually.</p>
<p>Another problem is that you currently cannot change the color of your polygon outlines - as a result, if you have small polygons close together, all you see on smaller screens is the black outline rather than the map-related color of the geographic unit.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="scmatrix">Applications for scatter plot matrices</a></b></p>
<p>Scatter plot matrices are useful for bivariate Moran scatter plots, e.g., where the neighboring values of one time are regressed on the observations of another time. Alternatively, a matrix can be created with different scatter plot types, e.g., comparing y and x in a regular scatter plot to x-lag and x in a Moran scatter plot, to y-lag and x in a bivariate scatter plot, and so on (for details, see the <a href="/system/files/geodaworkbook.pdf" target="_self">GeoDa workbook</a>, pp. 61-65 and pp. 160-162).</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="outliers">Assessing the leverage of outliers</a></b></p>
<p>Brushing the scatter plot with the Exclude Selected option activated allows you to explore the leverage of <a href="/node/390#outliers">outliers</a> by excluding extreme observations and recomputing the slope.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="con1">Condition a variable on East-West and North-South</a></b></p>
<p>In a <a href="/node/390#conplot">conditional map</a>, if you choose x and y coordinates as your x and y variables, you can explore patterns in a variable by changing East-West and North-South thresholds.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="con2">Create a map with a continuous color ramp</a></b></p>
<p>In a <a href="/node/390#conplot">conditional map</a>, if you move all the map dividers and dot levers out to the top and right, you can create a single map with a continuous color ramp (as opposed to quantiles or other intervals).</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="excess">Why are there differences between my excess risk and raw rate map?</a></b></p>
<p>When the distribution of your data is highly skewed, a quantile map based on raw rates can show areas as high that are shown as low values in an excess risk map. This occurs when your median is below the mean since the raw rate map depicts values above the median as high while they show up as below the mean in the excess risk map.</p>

<h2>
	Weights and Spatial Autocorrelation</h2>
<p><b><a name="choice">Which weights matrix should I choose?</a></b></p>
<p>The choice of <a href="/node/390#wghts">weights</a> should ultimately be driven by a rationale for including those areas as neighbors that have a spatial effect on a given location. This rationale can be derived from theory or be the result of using <a href="/node/390#esda">ESDA</a> to experiment with different weights and connectivity orders. Since weights matrices are used to create spatial lags that average neighboring values, the choice of a weights matrix will determine which neighboring values will be averaged. For instance, since rook weights will usually have fewer neighbors than queen weights, on average, each neighboring observation has more influence.</p>
<p>The question of which weights to choose is more pertinent in the context of modeling than ESDA since modeling is based on substantive notions of spatial effects while ESDA prioritizes the rejection of spatial randomness. Therefore, if there are no substantive reasons to guide the choice of weights in ESDA, using a weights file with as few neighbors as possible (such as rook) makes sense. Especially with irregular areal units (as opposed to grids), the difference between <a href="/node/390#rook">rook</a> and <a href="/node/390#queen">queen</a> weights is often minimal. However, it is advisable to test how sensitive your results are to your weights specifications by comparing multiple weights matrices.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="new">Create your own weights</a></b></p>
<p>You can create your own weights file outside of GeoDa but it has to be in binary format. This means that neighbors are defined by zeros and ones, not by other values, e.g., continuous values that reflect a weighting scheme. The weights file has to match the contiguity format used in GeoDa&#39;s .gal and .gwt files (see the <a href="/software/documentation" target="_self">GeoDa Manuals</a> for details). Note that the third column in the .gwt distance weights file is not currently used for <a href="#invdist">inverse distance weighting</a> since GeoDa uses <a href="/node/390#distwgts">distance bands</a>.</p>
<p>You can create weights based on criteria other than geographic proximity. However, note that weights are assumed to be exogenous in spatial regression modeling. To avoid endogeneity and circular reasoning, care should be taken to not build too many assumptions and parameters into the weights.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="dist">What happens when I set the threshold distance lower than the default?</a></b></p>
<p>The default distance threshold ensures that every observation has at least one neighbor. If you set the threshold distance as smaller than the default minimum, GeoDa will create a <a href="/node/390#wghts">weights matrix</a> based on your threshold, not the default, i.e., it will contain &quot;island&quot; observations without neighbors. You can easily check this by looking at the weights characteristics in GeoDa and by opening the weights matrix in a text editor.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the difference between the matrix with the default minimum threshold and yours, create both matrices and compare them by looking at their <a href="/node/380#hist">weights characteristics</a> (which is a histogram of the number of neighbors for all observations). You will see that the minimum threshold matrix has no observations with zero neighbors while yours will have observations with zero neighbors.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="invdist">Does GeoDa include inverse distance weighting?</a></b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="/node/390#distwgts">Distance bands</a></li>
	<li>
		<a href="/node/390#knn">K-nearest neighbors</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create two types of distance-based weights (with .gwt file extensions) in GeoDa:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>GeoDa currently does not yet implement inverse distance weighting (i.e., the third column with distances in the .gwt file is only used to determine whether a point is within a distance band or not). The extent of the distance band is specified by your threshold distance (the default value ensures that you have no islands). GeoDa row-standardizes weights, i.e., the rows sum to 1.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>If the size of your areas varies considerably, you might be interested in using K-nearest neighbors, which ensures that every point has the same number of neighbors. Note, however, that you cannot yet run or get correct results for <a href="/node/404#crash">spatial lag or error models with KNN weights</a> in GeoDa since these weights are asymmetric.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="unit">How do I get the distance units I want?</a></b></p>
<p>If you need the metric displayed in the distance weights threshold box to reflect a particular unit (e.g., feet or miles), project your <a href="/node/390#shape">shape file</a> first and set the desired units in another program such as a <a href="/node/390#gis">GIS</a>. Then create the weights based on this file.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="isle">What to do with islands?</a></b></p>
<p>Islands should not be used for LISA maps and can be problematic for GeoDa&#39;s regression models. One option to ensure no islands is to use distance weights (distance bands or k-nearest neighbors). You can also remove islands using a <a href="/node/390#gis">GIS</a> or assign them to other areas that are similar by editing the weights matrix in a text editor (for details on the weights formats, see the <a href="/pdf/geoda093.pdf" target="_self">GeoDa 0.9.3 User&#39;s Guide</a>, pp. 80-81). You will need to assign a mainland area ID to the island ID, and vice versa, assign the island ID to the mainland ID.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="projection">How do I project my shape file?</a></b></p>
<p>GeoDa does not contain any map projection tools. Map projections can be relevant when using GeoDa&#39;s distance weights, which are based on the distances between points. You can set the distance units displayed in the weights distance dialog (e.g., feet, meters, or miles) by first projecting the shape file outside of GeoDa. More information on the <a href="/openspace/2005-May/000503.html">distance units</a>.</p>
<p>Project your shape file outside of GeoDa using a <a href="/node/390#gis">GIS</a> or other program. More information on <a href="/openspace/2005-September/000550.html">Openspace1 (September 2005)</a> and <a href="/openspace/2005-September/000567.html">Openspace2 (September 2005)</a>.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="lisactr">LISA maps only show cluster center</a></b></p>
<p>Note that the cluster map only shows the <i>center</i> of the cluster in color (e.g., red for a high-high cluster). The actual extend of the cluster includes the center and the surrounding neighbors as defined by the <a href="/node/390#wghts">weights matrix</a>. If you are not sure which units are neighbors, open the weights file in a text editor to determine the neighborhood structure.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="lisaisle">LISA maps incompatible with islands</a></b></p>
<p>Do not create <a href="/node/390#lisa2">local Moran</a> maps for <a href="/node/390#shape">shape files</a> with islands since the significance levels for the islands will not be computed correctly. You can use distance weights (distance bands or k-nearest neighbors) or exclude the islands from the shape file in a <a href="/node/390#gis">mapping program</a> outside of GeoDa (or edit the shape file manually in ASCII after <a href="/node/403#tobndh">exporting it from GeoDa</a>). Or you can manually edit your weights file in a text editor and associate the island with the mainland (<a href="#isle">more information</a>).</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="lisasig">Assess sensitivity of LISA results</a></b></p>
<p>To assess the sensitivity of your results, run several <a href="/node/390#perm">permutations</a> and apply several significance filters. This way you can explore which clusters and spatial outliers remain stable throughout.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="lisabox">My box map does not reflect my LISA map - why?</a></b></p>
<p>The box map&#39;s quantile categories, like the box plot&#39;s, are based on the median. With highly skewed distributions (e.g., when the mean is much lower than the median), the box map&#39;s categories might not reflect the same pattern as the LISA map. When the distribution is symmetric, the box map and LISA map results are very similar.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="robust">How robust is the pseudo p-value?</a></b></p>
<p>Explore how robust your observed Moran&#39;s I value is compared to the <a href="/node/390#random">randomized</a> reference distribution. In the <a href="/node/390#gmoran">Moran scatter plot</a>, increase the number of permutations from 99 up and test if the relationship between the observed and randomized Moran&#39;s I changes. In the <a href="/node/390#lisa2">LISA</a> maps, increase the number of randomizations from 99 permutations up to see if the clusters change.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="boundary">Testing for boundary effects</a></b></p>
<p><a href="/node/389#brush"><img alt="How To" height="30" src="/images/howto.gif" width="49" /></a></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		You can explore if the assumption of stationarity is violated by boundary effects. Open the Moran scatter plot (with the Exclude Selected option turned on). Open a map and select the areas next to the boundary of your shape file. Test if the slope/Moran&#39;s I changes when the boundary areas are excluded.</li>

<h2>
	Rates and Smoothing</h2>
<p><b><a name="smooth">Sensitivity analysis of different smoothers</a></b></p>
<p>To assess how sensitive the identification of outliers is to a specific <a href="/node/390#smooth">smoothing</a> technique, you can visually compare the different smoothers in GeoDa. Create four maps (raw rate, EB-smoothed, spatial rate, and EBS-smoothed) and choose the <a href="/node/390#boxmap">box map</a> option under map themes when you choose your <a href="/node/390#event">base and event variables</a>.</p>
<p>One of the considerations in choosing between smoothers is that the area where strength is borrowed from to correct for local variance instability should be representative of the underlying risk in a local area.</p>
<p>You can also open one or more <a href="/node/390#boxplot">box plot(s)</a> of the raw rate and/or the smoothed rates to explore the differences in <a href="/node/390#outliers">outliers</a> through linking and brushing.</p>

<h2>
	Regression</h2>
<p><b><a name="moran">How can I see the p-value for Moran&#39;s I in my output?</a></b></p>
<p>To get the p-value for Moran&#39;s I in the regression output, check the 3rd box at the initial input window &quot;Moran&#39;s I z-value&quot;. Once it&#39;s checked the N/A changes to a value.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><a name="regout">Run regression without opening project</a></b></p>
<p>You can access GeoDa&#39;s regression functionality without opening a <a href="/node/390#shape">shape file</a> by going directly to Regress after opening GeoDa. This option is particularly useful if you are working with large datasets (e.g., several hundred thousand observations), to avoid long loading times of the map file. Note that this option does not work if the constant is not selected.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
